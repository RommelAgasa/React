/**
 * The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.
 * It allows for more complex state logic in a component.
 * It is usually preferable to use useState for simpler state logic.
 * It is used when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
 * It also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
